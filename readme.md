## Electron Screen Reader app

A little app to learn how Electron works.


To get the app running:
- clone the repo
- cd into the project
- `npm start` --> this should get the app running

To make the app run on different operating systems run:
```
npm run make
```
This will automatically detect the operating system you are on and will build the distributable for that OS.
